# GitHub Upload Instructions

## 🚀 Ready to Upload to GitHub!

Your Gmail Article Search Agent project is fully organized and ready for GitHub upload. Follow these steps to create your repository:

## 📋 Step-by-Step Upload Process

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository:
- **Repository name**: `gmail-article-search-agent`
- **Description**: "Enterprise-grade multi-agent AI system for Gmail article discovery and intelligent search"
- **Visibility**: Public (or Private if preferred)
- **Initialize**: Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

### 2. Connect Local Repository to GitHub
```bash
# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gmail-article-search-agent.git

# Verify remote was added
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify Upload
Check your GitHub repository to ensure all files uploaded correctly:
- ✅ Clean project structure with organized folders
- ✅ Comprehensive README.md with documentation
- ✅ Complete codebase with all agents and services
- ✅ Infrastructure code and deployment scripts
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflows
- ✅ Test suite and documentation

## 🔐 Important Security Notes

### Before Upload - Remove Sensitive Data
Ensure these files/folders are excluded (already in .gitignore):
- ✅ `.env` files with actual credentials
- ✅ `credentials/` folder with OAuth tokens
- ✅ `models/` folder with downloaded models
- ✅ `venv/` virtual environment
- ✅ `__pycache__/` Python cache files
- ✅ `.pytest_cache/` test cache
- ✅ Database backup files

### After Upload - Configure Secrets
Set up GitHub repository secrets for CI/CD:
1. Go to your repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Add these secrets:
   - `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: Your Google Cloud project ID
   - `GCP_SA_KEY`: Service account key JSON (base64 encoded)
